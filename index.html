        <h2>In terms of what Cairo lays out as five qualities of great visualizations, this one meets them all or is at least passable.</h2>
        <h3>The visualization is</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Truthful. It is not false or misleading.</li>
            <li>Functional. The visualization is simple and straightforward and accurately expresses what it is trying to show. </li>
            <li>Beautiful. Ok, this one's a bit of a stretch. But it isn't difficult to look at and its colors are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Insightful. By pointing out which stocks are improving and by how much, the graph helps us out tremendously, since it would difficult to tell otherwise.</li>
            <li>Enlightening. Another category where the graph is only meh. I don't think knowing which sectors performed well today will drastically change our lives, but by looking at the graph we certainly get the point in a concise and simple way.</li>
            
        </ol>

        <h1>This is a <span style="color:red;">bad</span> visualization.</h1>

        <h2>In terms of what Cairo lays out as five qualities of great visualizations, this one fails all the criteria.</h2>
        <h3>The visualization is <em>not</em></h3>
        
        
        <ol>
            <li>Truthful. The research appears to be of lesser quality, as the percentages do not add up to 100.</li>
            <li>Functional. The visualization is not easy to understand, and doesn't even make sense if you do comprehend it.</li>
            <li>Beautiful. Maybe, but probably not. I guess it's up to interpretation.</li>
            <li>Insightful. Again, not very clear and doesn't make sense.</li>
            <li>Enlightening. Because of it's failure to depict insightful data in a nice, clear way, the visualization fails to make an impression.</li>
            
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Ways it could be improved include fixing the poor research job done on the data, laying out the data in a different shape than a walking person, and having corresponding widths in color according to percentage values.</h4>
